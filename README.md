## Requirements and Details

* iOS 8.0+
* Xcode 7.3 or above
* Built with Swift 2.2

## Installation

### CocoaPods

```ruby
	use_frameworks!
	pod 'SwiftLinkPreview', '~> 0.0.1'
```

### Manually

Although it's not recommended, you just need to drop SwiftLinkPreview folder into Xcode project (make sure to enable "Copy items if needed" and "Create groups").


## Usage

```swift
import SwiftLinkPreview

// ...

let slp = SwiftLinkPreview()

slp.get(
    "Text containing url",
    onSuccess: { result in
    	
        NSLog("\(result)")
        
    },
    onError: { error in
       
       NSLog("\(error)")
        
    }
)
```

### Result

The result is a dictionary ```[String: AnyObject]```:

```swift
	[
       "title": "title",
       "url": "original URL",
       "finalUrl": "final ~unshortened~ URL.",
       "canonicalUrl": "canonical URL",
       "description": "page description or relevant text",
       "images": ["array of URLs of the images"]
   ]
```

## Important

You need to set ```Allow Arbitrary Loads``` to ```YES``` on your project's Info.plist file.
