# Swift Link Preview

**Under Development ðŸ› **

Swift version from my previous projects [Link Preview (PHP + Angular + Bootstrap)](https://github.com/LeonardoCardoso/Link-Preview) and [Android Link Preview](https://github.com/LeonardoCardoso/Android-Link-Preview).

It makes a preview from an url, grabbing all the information such as title, relevant texts and images.
